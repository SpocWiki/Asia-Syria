> **Ugarit** (Ugaritic: 𐎜𐎂𐎗𐎚, ủgrt /ʾUgarītu/) was an ancient Levantine coastal city 
> located in what is today northern Syria. 
> 
> The site, with its corpus of ancient cuneiform texts, was discovered in 1928. 
> The texts were written in a previously unknown Northwest Semitic tongue—
> the Ugaritic language. 
> 
> Archaeological excavations of Ugarit show evidence of 
> occupation since the 8th millennium BC. 
> 
> Research has focused on the late Bronze Age levels; 
> relatively little is known about earlier occupation. 
> The ongoing archaeological investigation of Ugarit has proven to be 
> invaluable to the study of the Bronze Age in the eastern Mediterranean.
>
> Ugarit is 10 km north of the Syrian city Latakia; 
> at its zenith it ruled an area roughly equivalent to the modern Latakia Governorate. 
> The ruins are often called "Ras Shamra" or "Tell Shamra" after the local place names.
