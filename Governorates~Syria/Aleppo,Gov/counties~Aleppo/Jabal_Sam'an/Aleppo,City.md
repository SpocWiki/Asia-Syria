# [[Aleppo,City]]

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Aleppo** is the largest city in Syria by area and serves as 
> the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most populous governorate of Syria. 
> 
> With an estimated population of 2,098,000 residents as of 2021, 
> it is Syria's largest city by urban area, and was the primary economic centre 
> until it was surpassed by Damascus, the capital of Syria. 
> 
> Aleppo is also the largest city in Syria's northern governorates 
> and one of the largest cities in the Levant region.
>
> Aleppo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world; 
> it may have been inhabited since the sixth millennium BC. 
> 
> Excavations at Tell as-Sawda and Tell al-Ansari, just south of the old city of Aleppo, 
> show that the area was occupied by Amorites by the latter part of the third millennium BC. 
> 
> That is also the time at which Aleppo is first mentioned in cuneiform tablets 
> unearthed in Ebla and Mesopotamia, 
> which speak of it as part of the Amorite state of Yamhad, 
> and note its commercial and military importance. 
> 
> Such a long history is attributed to its strategic location 
> as a trading center between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia. 
> 
> For centuries, Aleppo was the largest city in the Syrian region, 
> and the Ottoman Empire's third-largest after Constantinople (now Istanbul) and Cairo. 
> 
> The city's significance in history has been its location at one end of the Silk Road, 
> which passed through Central Asia and Mesopotamia. 
> When the Suez Canal was inaugurated in 1869, 
> much trade was diverted to sea and Aleppo began its slow decline.
>
> At the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, 
> Aleppo lost its northern hinterland to modern Turkey, 
> as well as the important Baghdad Railway connecting it to Mosul. 
> 
> In 1939, it lost its main access to the sea, by Antakya and İskenderun, also to Turkey. 
> 
> The growth in importance of Damascus in the past few decades 
> further exacerbated the situation. 
> 
> This decline may have helped to preserve the old city of Aleppo, 
> its medieval architecture and traditional heritage. 
> 
> It won the title of the Islamic Capital of Culture 2006 
> and has had a wave of successful restorations of its historic landmarks. 
> 
> The battle of Aleppo occurred in the city during the Syrian civil war, 
> and many parts of the city suffered massive destruction. 
> 
> Affected parts of the city are currently undergoing reconstruction. 
> 
> An estimated 31,000 people were killed in Aleppo during the conflict.
